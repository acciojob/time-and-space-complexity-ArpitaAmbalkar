  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to how the running time of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. A lower time complexity often indicates a more efficient algorithm.

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size increases. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial when optimizing programs, especially when dealing with constraints like O(n) memory usage.
